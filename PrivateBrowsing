While its in the incognito mode it want save the following cookies and site data.
The history is not tracked as well.You have the option to block your location in this mode.
A person might use this mode to keep from having so many cookies on their computer or for forensic measures.
As a QA I would use incognito if the test required me too.
Meanwhile I would use incognito otherwise.
